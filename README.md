# Overview

This is the famous prologue to the world of software. This is where we begin our journey. 

The simple message "Hello World" is printed. What I love most about the "Hello World" program is that the computer seems to suddenly come to life.

This is created to show the average person that even coding starts out very simple; they can learn to code if they would like.
